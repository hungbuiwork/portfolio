                I am a fourth-year student at the University of California,
                Irvine. I'm passionate about creation, whether through art,
                programming, or other means. I channel this passion into
                font-end development and game development. I am a
                detail-oriented programmer, with several collaborative
                experiences, with a focus on writing well-structured code and
                visually appealing user interfaces.

                  Initially, I harbored a strong interest in game development.
                  However, I have since broadened my focus to encompass web
                  development, aspiring to become a full-stack developer. I am
                  deeply passionate about exploring new technologies and
                  venturing beyond my comfort zone. My primary objective is to
                  immerse myself in the industry, gaining firsthand experience
                  and understanding the intricacies of software production
                  within expansive teams.

                  creations and programming, technical art has been the subfield
                  of game development that I am most passionate about, where I

                  development as ell as technical art within game development
                  are two fields of work that resonates most with my passions,

                collegiate acapella group. I also love growing and collecting
                tropical plant species. I love to incorporate these things I
                love: art, music, plants into what I create on my free time,
                such as in my procedural plant generator in the projects
                section, as well as the website/social media design in my
                acapella group!
