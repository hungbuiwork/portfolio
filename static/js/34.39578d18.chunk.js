The key distinction between them lay in their input methods (keyboard for players, AI for enemies) and their movement patterns. This approach enabled us to maintain a modular codebase and efficiently reuse various components. An exciting benefit of this design was that any entity could seamlessly utilize newly created weapons. This flexibility proved invaluable when implementing the boss character, as it simply inherited behaviors from other enemy types and employed the same arsenal. Furthermore, I implemented optimizations to enhance performance by limiting enemy spawning and updates to the current room or adjacent ones. This optimization significantly improved our game's performance. As the sole developer responsible for the enemy AI, I devised a system that utilized scriptable objects known as 'enemy brains.' These objects comprised a set of predefined values, which in turn generated diverse behaviors. This approach not only reduced the amount of code required but also facilitated the rapid creation of enemies with distinct behaviors. For instance, it allowed us to easily differentiate the strafing behavior of violin enemies from the charging and rolling tactics of drum enemies."},{description:"Leading the project proved to be challenging.
